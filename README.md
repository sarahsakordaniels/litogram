Litogram is a web app for people who have some time to kill and maybe feel like
aimlessly browsing the web or looking at their phone.  This is usually when we
would go to social media, or some popular blog or news site.  But sometimes we
might just want to read something simple, look at a piece of art, or learn a new
thing without being distracted or sold anything.  That is what Litogram is for!

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
  * Clone the github [repository](https://github.com/sarahsakordaniels/litogram)
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the parent folder
  * Run 'bundle install'
  * Run 'rake db: migrate'
  * Run 'rake db:seed'
```
<!-- This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). -->


## Usage

Just visit our web site and you will get a random short story, poem, word of the day, or
work of art.  Press the 'Next' button for a new thing.  If you only want to read, or only
want to look at images then click on the corresponding tab at the top of the screen.  If
you'd like to add content then please contact one of our admins to send you a link to sign
up for an account.  We don't just give these out to anyone.  Litogram is not meant to be
a social space or place for sharing anything in particular.  It is a place to just enjoy
a piece of art free of distraction!   

<!-- _For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._ -->

## Development setup

This project is still in development (obviously).  But if you would like to contribute
please feel free to fork our [repository](https://github.com/sarahsakordaniels/litogram) and submit a pull request!  Just clone down the repository,
navigate to the parent folder and run the program by entering 'bundle install' and 'rails db:seed' into the terminal.  We built this project in Rails and so all the normal rails commands are included.  Enter 'rails c'
into the terminal to interact with the console and database.


Any help would be most appreciated:)
